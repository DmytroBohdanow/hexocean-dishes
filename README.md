Hello! 

I want to introduce my project, made for Hexocean as a recruitment exercise.

It represents the form of ordering a dish, built with react, redux, and redux-form. 
I consider as the main feature that the app makes a request, receives the answer, and saves it into the store fully asynchronically with help of redux-thunk


To run the project, in the project directory, you should:

### Download the source files
### `yarn install` or `npm install` to install dependencies
### `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the app

Enjoy!
